## Troubleshooting
If the latest version of the DApp does not load on your mobile device:
- **Clear Browser Cache**: Go to your browser settings (e.g., Chrome: Settings → Privacy and security → Clear browsing data; Safari: Settings → Safari → Clear History and Website Data).
- **Use Incognito Mode**: Open the site in a private/incognito tab to bypass cached content.
- **Append Query String**: Add `?v=2` to the URL (e.g., `https://dapp.truesight.me/?v=2`) to force a fresh load.
- **Wait for CDN Refresh**: GitHub Pages may take up to 10 minutes to reflect changes due to CDN caching. Check the deployment status in the repository’s **Actions** tab.
